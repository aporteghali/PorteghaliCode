# PorteghaliCode
Just glad to share some codes that I think may be of some help to someone on earth!

I combined the methods proposed by TH Todorov at https://stackoverflow.com/a/30025029 and James Hill, at How to cut a part of image in C# (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18424624/using-selenium-to-save-images-from-page) and came up with the following code. it works perfectly in a case, there is no need to save picture on a drive. It also works for any image in a website. I hope this is of some help.
